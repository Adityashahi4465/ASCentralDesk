## Introduction üî•üî•üëãüëã

In this fast-moving world with intensive coursework, students find very less time to share their problems to overcome with this problem E-ASComplaints is here it is  a system designed to handle complaints, suggestions, and feedback from university, Notices, Events. 
students and faculty. It allows individuals to submit their complaints online, using a unique complaint ID, 
which is then forwarded to the relevant department for resolution. The complaint ID is used to track the 
progress of the complaint and ensure that it is properly addressed and resolved.
A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

All students and faculty members have access to view the complaints that have been registered in the 
system, allowing them to stay informed about the issues that are being addressed on campus. The 
department responsible for handling a particular complaint can communicate with the student or faculty 
member via email, using the system's built-in messaging feature. This allows for efficient and effective 
communication, ensuring that all parties are kept up-to-date on the status of the complaint.

Overall, the E-ASComplaint box aims to provide a convenient and easy-to-use platform for students and 
faculty to voice their concerns and have them addressed in a timely and effective manner and recive importent event notfications and notices from admins.

**Academic Perspective**
The ‚ÄúOnline Complaint Management System‚Äù software is an independent application. It is a self-contained 
complain. The system interfaces, user interfaces and hardware interfaces related with this software are 
defined as follows.

****System Interfaces****

The student systems should be able to share the data available in the data base through the network 
connection.

****User Interfaces****

The screen formats and menu structure should be in such a way that even have students will find it easy to 
use.


## OBJECTIVESüéØüéØ
_Resolving student problems_ : The aim of this objective is to address any issues or problems that students 
may be experiencing, and to find ways to resolve those problems in a timely and effective manner. This 
could include problems related to academic matters, such as coursework or exams, or non-academic issues, 
such as housing or financial concerns.

_Identifying areas for improvement_ :  This objective involves identifying areas where the academic or 
administrative operations of the university could be improved upon. This could involve analyzing data and 
feedback from students, faculty, and other team of DSEU management to identify patterns or trends, and 
then developing strategies to address those issue.

_Balanced relationship among faculty and students_ :  This objective aims to promote a positive and 
productive relationship between faculty and students, ensuring that both groups feel respected and valued. 
This could involve initiatives such as providing training or support for faculty to improve their teaching 
and mentorship skills, or creating opportunities for students to give feedback and have a say in decision-making processes.

_Written Response_ : This objective involves providing a written response to any complaints or issues 
raised through the e-complaint box system. This could include acknowledging the complaint, outlining the 
steps that will be taken to address the issue, and providing updates on the progress of the resolution 
proces

_Handle complaints quickly and effectively_ : This objective aims to ensure that complaints are addressed 
in a timely manner, and that appropriate action is taken to resolve the issue. This could involve setting 
targets or benchmarks for response times, or implementing processes to ensure that complaints are 
escalated to the appropriate parties if they are not being addressed promptly.

_Keep the complainant informed and involved_ : This objective involves keeping the concern person who 
raised the complaint informed about the progress of the resolution process, and involving them in any 
decisions or actions that are taken. This could involve providing regular updates, seeking feedback or input 
from the complainant, or involving them in any relevant meetings or discussions. Overall, the aim of this 
objective is to ensure that the complainant feels heard and valued, and that their concerns are being taken 
seriously.

## RESULTS AND FINDINGS
The result of implementing an e-complaint box 
system should be increased efficiency and 
improved satisfaction for students and faculty. 
However, it is important for organizations to 
consider potential technical issues and privacy 
concerns, and to ensure compliance with 
relevant legal and regulatory frameworks. 
Further research is needed to identify best practices for implementing and using e-complaint boxes 
effectively.


**Conclusion** : The testing of the mobile application on different platforms was successful, and the app is 
now ready for showing to faculty. The major changes made to merge the two apps into a single application 
did not cause any major issues, and the app performed well on all devices. We would like to thank the 
faculty for their suggestion to merge the apps, which has resulted in a more streamlined and user-friendly 
experience for users.

## FUTURE GOALS 

**Enhanced functionality:** The E-ASComplaint system could be expanded to include additional 
features, such as ability to submit 
anonymous complaints.

**Improved integration:** The E-ASComplaint box system could be integrated with other university 
systems, such as student records or course management systems, to provide a more comprehensive view of 
student concerns.
