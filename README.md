## Inroduction 

In this fast-moving world with intensive coursework, students find very less time to share their problems. At almost every university, the students have to register offline complaint registration opening only 2-3 hours a day which some students miss. This project focuses on the digitization of these complaint management systems and provide their easy access to students.
